# OpenAI

{% hint style="info" %}
On n8n Cloud, you can use the OpenAI node with [Gateway credits](https://app.gitbook.com/s/jm0ZYRpZIPWge2ZSiDYO/use-n8n-cloud/gateway-credits) instead of your own OpenAI API key. Select **Use Gateway credits** in the node's credential field to run the node without an OpenAI account.
{% endhint %}

Use the OpenAI node to automate work in OpenAI and integrate OpenAI with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of OpenAI features, including creating images and assistants, as well as chatting with models.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the OpenAI node supports and links to more resources.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Feature availability**

The OpenAI node V2 is available from n8n 1.117.0. It supports the OpenAI Responses API, and removes support for [the Assistants API, which OpenAI has announced plans to retire](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/migration).

From n8n 1.29.0, the OpenAI node replaces the OpenAI assistant node.

**Credentials**

Refer to [OpenAI credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai.md) for guidance on setting up authentication.

## What to do if your operation isn't supported

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest.md) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
2. Select the service you want to connect to.
3. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/builtin/custom-api-actions-for-existing-nodes.md) for more information.

## Using tools with OpenAI assistants <a href="#using-tools-with-openai-assistants" id="using-tools-with-openai-assistants"></a>

Some operations allow you to connect tools. [Tools](/build/integrate-ai/understand-ai-components/how-tools-work.md) act like addons that your AI can use to access extra context or resources.

Select the **Tools** connector to browse the available tools and add them.

Once you add a tool connection, the OpenAI node becomes a [root node](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], allowing it to form a [cluster node](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] with the tools sub-nodes[^3]. See [Node types](/integrations/builtin/node-types.md#cluster-nodes) for more information on cluster nodes and root nodes.

## Common issues <a href="#common-issues" id="common-issues"></a>

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common issues](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/common-issues.md).

[^1]: Each n8n cluster node contains a single root nodes that defines the main functionality of the cluster. One or more sub nodes attach to the root node to extend its functionality.

[^2]: In n8n, cluster nodes are groups of nodes that work together to provide functionality in a workflow. They consist of a root node and one or more sub nodes that extend the node's functionality.

[^3]: n8n cluster nodes consist of one or more sub nodes connected to a root node. Sub nodes extend the functionality of the root node, providing access to specific services or resources or offering specific types of dedicated processing, like calculator functionality, for example.
