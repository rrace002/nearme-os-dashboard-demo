# Twist

Use the Twist node to automate work in Twist, and integrate Twist with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Twist features, including creating conversations in a channel, as well as creating and deleting comments on a thread.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Twist node supports and links to more resources.

## What to do if your operation isn't supported

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest.md) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
2. Select the service you want to connect to.
3. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/builtin/custom-api-actions-for-existing-nodes.md) for more information.

## Get the User ID <a href="#get-the-user-id" id="get-the-user-id"></a>

To get the User ID for a user:

1. Open the **Team** tab.
2. Select a user's avatar.
3. Copy the string of characters located after `/u/` in your Twist URL. This string is the User ID. For example, if the URL is `https://twist.com/a/4qw45/people/u/475370` the User ID is `475370`.
