# Line

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Feature availability**

The Line node is deprecated from n8n 1.64.0. LINE Notify ends its own service on April 1, 2025, after which the node stops working. View LINE Notify's [end of service announcement](https://notify-bot.line.me/closing-announce) for more information.
{% endhint %}

Use the Line node to automate work in Line, and integrate Line with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Line features, including sending notifications.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Line node supports and links to more resources.

## What to do if your operation isn't supported

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest.md) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
2. Select the service you want to connect to.
3. Select your credential.
