# Cortex

Use the Cortex node to automate work in Cortex, and integrate Cortex with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Cortex features, including executing analyzers, and responders, as well as getting job details.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Cortex node supports and links to more resources.

## What to do if your operation isn't supported

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest.md) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
2. Select the service you want to connect to.
3. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/builtin/custom-api-actions-for-existing-nodes.md) for more information.
