# Supabase

Use the Supabase node to automate work in Supabase, and integrate Supabase with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Supabase features, including creating, deleting, and getting rows.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Supabase node supports and links to more resources.

**This node can be used as an AI tool**

This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](/build/integrate-ai/ai-examples/use-ai-for-parameters.md).

* Row
  * Create a new row
  * Delete a row
  * Get a row

## Using custom schemas <a href="#using-custom-schemas" id="using-custom-schemas"></a>

By default, the Supabase node only fetches the `public` schema. To fetch [custom schemas](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/using-custom-schemas), enable **Use Custom Schema**.

In the new **Schema** field, provide the custom schema the Supabase node should use.

## Templates and examples <a href="#templates-and-examples" id="templates-and-examples"></a>

## What to do if your operation isn't supported

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest.md) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
2. Select the service you want to connect to.
3. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/builtin/custom-api-actions-for-existing-nodes.md) for more information.

## Common issues <a href="#common-issues" id="common-issues"></a>
