# Anthropic

{% hint style="info" %}
On n8n Cloud, you can use the Anthropic node with [Gateway credits](https://app.gitbook.com/s/jm0ZYRpZIPWge2ZSiDYO/use-n8n-cloud/gateway-credits) instead of your own Anthropic API key. Select **Use Gateway credits** in the node's credential field to run the node without an Anthropic account.
{% endhint %}

Use the Anthropic node to automate work in Anthropic and integrate Anthropic with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Anthropic features, including analyzing, uploading, getting, and deleting documents, files, and images, and generating, improving, or templatizing prompts.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Anthropic node supports, and links to more resources.
