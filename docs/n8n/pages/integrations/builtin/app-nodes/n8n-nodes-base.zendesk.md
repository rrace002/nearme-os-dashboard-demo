# Zendesk

Use the Zendesk node to automate work in Zendesk, and integrate Zendesk with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Zendesk features, including creating, and deleting tickets, users, and organizations.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Zendesk node supports and links to more resources.

**This node can be used as an AI tool**

This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](/build/integrate-ai/ai-examples/use-ai-for-parameters.md).

**Tag Replacement Behavior**

When using the Zendesk node's "Update Ticket" operation and specifying the `Tag Names or IDs` field, the entire list of tags on the ticket **will be replaced**. Any tags not included in the update will be removed from the ticket due to how the Zendesk API processes tag updates by default.

**To avoid accidental tag removal:**

* First retrieve the ticket's tags and merge them with your new tags before updating.
* Alternatively, use the HTTP Request node with Zendesk's `additional_tags` property to add tags without removing existing ones.
* You can also call the ticket's `/tags` endpoint to add tags without replacing existing ones ([Zendesk tags endpoint documentation](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/ticket-management/tags/)).

See the official documentation for details: [Adding tags to tickets without overwriting existing tags](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/adding-tags-to-tickets-without-overwriting-existing-tags/).

## What to do if your operation isn't supported

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest.md) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
2. Select the service you want to connect to.
3. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/builtin/custom-api-actions-for-existing-nodes.md) for more information.
