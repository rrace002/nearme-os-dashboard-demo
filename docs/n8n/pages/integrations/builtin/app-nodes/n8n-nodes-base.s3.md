# S3

Use the S3 node to automate work in non-AWS S3 storage and integrate S3 with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of S3 features, including creating, deleting, and getting buckets, files, and folders. For AWS S3, use [AWS S3](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.awss3.md).

Use the S3 node for non-AWS S3 solutions like:

* [MinIO](https://min.io/)
* [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/)
* [Digital Ocean spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces)

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the S3 node supports and links to more resources.

**Credentials**

Refer to [S3 credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/s3.md) for guidance on setting up authentication.

**This node can be used as an AI tool**

This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](/build/integrate-ai/ai-examples/use-ai-for-parameters.md).
