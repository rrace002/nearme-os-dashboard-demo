# Airtop

Use the Airtop node to automate work in Airtop, and integrate Airtop with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Airtop features, enabling you to control a cloud-based web browser for tasks like querying, scraping, and interacting with web pages.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Airtop node supports, and links to more resources.

## What to do if your operation isn't supported

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest.md) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
2. Select the service you want to connect to.
3. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/builtin/custom-api-actions-for-existing-nodes.md) for more information.

## Node reference <a href="#node-reference" id="node-reference"></a>

### Create a session and window <a href="#create-a-session-and-window" id="create-a-session-and-window"></a>

Create an Airtop browser session to get a **Session ID**, then use it to create a new browser window. After this, you can use any extraction or interaction operation.

### Extract content <a href="#extract-content" id="extract-content"></a>

Extract content from a web browser using these operations:

* **Query page**: Extract information from the current window.
* **Query page with pagination**: Extract information from pages with pagination or infinite scrolling.
* **Smart scrape page**: Get the window content as markdown.

Get JSON responses by using the **JSON Output Schema** parameter in query operations.

### Interacting with pages <a href="#interacting-with-pages" id="interacting-with-pages"></a>

Click, hover, or type on elements by describing the element you want to interact with.

### Terminate a session <a href="#terminate-a-session" id="terminate-a-session"></a>

End your session to save resources. Sessions are automatically terminated based on the **Idle Timeout** set in the **Create Session** operation or can be manually terminated using the **Terminate Session** operation.
