# Microsoft OneDrive

Use the Microsoft OneDrive node to automate work in Microsoft OneDrive, and integrate Microsoft OneDrive with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Microsoft OneDrive features, including creating, updating, deleting, and getting files, and folders.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Microsoft OneDrive node supports and links to more resources.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Credentials**

This node's **Authentication** dropdown offers three options:

* **OneDrive OAuth2**: the Microsoft OneDrive-specific OAuth2 credential (default).
* **Microsoft OAuth2 (Graph)**: a generic Microsoft Graph credential that you can reuse across other Microsoft nodes. When you select this option, make sure you grant the credential the scopes this node needs (for example, `Files.ReadWrite.All`).
* **Microsoft Entra Service Principal (App-Only)**: app-only access through a Microsoft Entra app registration, with no signed-in user. Refer to [Microsoft Entra Service Principal credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/microsoftentraserviceprincipal.md) for setup and required application permissions.

Refer to [Microsoft credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/microsoft.md) for guidance on setting up authentication.

**Government Cloud Support**

If you're using a government cloud tenant (US Government, US Government DOD, or China), make sure to select the appropriate **Microsoft Graph API Base URL** in your Microsoft credentials configuration.

**This node can be used as an AI tool**

This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](/build/integrate-ai/ai-examples/use-ai-for-parameters.md).

## Related resources <a href="#related-resources" id="related-resources"></a>

Refer to [Microsoft's OneDrive API documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/) for more information about the service.

## Find the folder ID <a href="#find-the-folder-id" id="find-the-folder-id"></a>

To perform operations on folders, you need to supply the ID. You can find this:

* In the URL of the folder
* By searching for it using the node. You need to do this if using MS 365 (where OneDrive uses SharePoint behind the scenes):
  1. Select **Resource** > **Folder**.
  2. Select **Operation** > **Search**.
  3. In **Query**, enter the folder name.
  4. Select **Execute step**. n8n runs the query and returns data about the folder, including an `id` field containing the folder ID.
