# Databricks

Use the Databricks node to automate work in Databricks, and integrate Databricks with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Databricks features, including executing SQL queries, managing Unity Catalog objects, querying ML model serving endpoints, and working with vector search indexes.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Databricks node supports and links to more resources.
