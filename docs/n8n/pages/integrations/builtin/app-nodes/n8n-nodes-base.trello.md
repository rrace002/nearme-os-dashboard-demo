# Trello

Use the Trello node to automate work in Trello, and integrate Trello with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Trello features, including creating and updating cards, and adding and removing members.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Trello node supports and links to more resources.

## What to do if your operation isn't supported

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest.md) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
2. Select the service you want to connect to.
3. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/builtin/custom-api-actions-for-existing-nodes.md) for more information.

## Find the List ID <a href="#find-the-list-id" id="find-the-list-id"></a>

1. Open the Trello board that contains the list.
2. If the list doesn't have any cards, add a card to the list.
3. Open the card, add `.json` at the end of the URL, and press enter.
4. In the JSON file, you will see a field called `idList`.
5. Copy the contents of the `idList`field and paste it in the \***List ID** field in n8n.
