# SendGrid

Use the SendGrid node to automate work in SendGrid, and integrate SendGrid with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of SendGrid features, including creating, updating, deleting, and getting contacts, and lists, as well as sending emails.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the SendGrid node supports and links to more resources.

**This node can be used as an AI tool**

This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](/build/integrate-ai/ai-examples/use-ai-for-parameters.md).

## What to do if your operation isn't supported

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest.md) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
2. Select the service you want to connect to.
3. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/builtin/custom-api-actions-for-existing-nodes.md) for more information.
