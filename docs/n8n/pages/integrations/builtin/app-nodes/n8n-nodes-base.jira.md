# Jira Software

Use the Jira Software node to automate work in Jira, and integrate Jira with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Jira features, including creating, updating, deleting, and getting issues, and users.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Jira Software node supports and links to more resources.

**This node can be used as an AI tool**

This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](/build/integrate-ai/ai-examples/use-ai-for-parameters.md).

## What to do if your operation isn't supported

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest.md) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
2. Select the service you want to connect to.
3. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/builtin/custom-api-actions-for-existing-nodes.md) for more information.

## Related resources <a href="#related-resources" id="related-resources"></a>

Refer to the [official JQL documentation](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/expand-jira/jql) about Jira Query Language (JQL) to learn more about it.

## Fetch issues for a specific project <a href="#fetch-issues-for-a-specific-project" id="fetch-issues-for-a-specific-project"></a>

The **Get All** operation returns all the issues from Jira. To fetch issues for a particular project, you need to use Jira Query Language (JQL).

For example, if you want to receive all the issues of a project named `n8n`, you'd do something like this:

* Select **Get All** from the **Operation** dropdown list.
* Toggle **Return All** to true.
* Select **Add Option** and select **JQL**.
* Enter `project=n8n` in the **JQL** field.

This query will fetch all the issues in the project named `n8n`. Enter the name of your project instead of `n8n` to fetch all the issues for your project.
