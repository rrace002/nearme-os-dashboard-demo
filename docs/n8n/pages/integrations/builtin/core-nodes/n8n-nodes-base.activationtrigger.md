# Activation Trigger

The Activation Trigger node gets triggered when an event gets fired by n8n or a workflow.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Feature availability**

The Activation Trigger node is deprecated from n8n 0.117.0. It was replaced with two new nodes: the [n8n Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8ntrigger.md) and the [Workflow Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.workflowtrigger.md). For more details, check out the entry in the [breaking changes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md#01170) page, and see [Deprecated and versioned nodes](/integrations/builtin/deprecated-nodes.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Keep in mind**

If you want to use the Activation Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.
{% endhint %}

The Activation Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Activation Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.
