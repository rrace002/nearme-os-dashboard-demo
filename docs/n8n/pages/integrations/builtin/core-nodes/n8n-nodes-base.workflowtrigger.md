# Workflow Trigger

The Workflow Trigger node gets triggered when a workflow is updated or activated.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Feature availability**

The Workflow Trigger node is deprecated from n8n 1.64.0. n8n moved its functionality to the [n8n Trigger node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8ntrigger.md). Refer to [Deprecated and versioned nodes](/integrations/builtin/deprecated-nodes.md) for more information.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Keep in mind**

If you want to use the Workflow Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.
{% endhint %}

The Workflow Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Workflow Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.

## Node parameters <a href="#node-parameters" id="node-parameters"></a>

The node includes a single parameter to identify the **Events** that should trigger it. Choose from these events:

* **Active Workflow Updated**: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is updated.
* **Workflow Activated**: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is activated.

You can select one or both of these events.
