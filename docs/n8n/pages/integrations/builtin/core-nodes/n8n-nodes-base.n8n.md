# n8n

A node to integrate with n8n itself. This node allows you to consume the [n8n API](/connect/n8n-api.md) in your workflows.

Refer to the [n8n REST API documentation](/connect/n8n-api.md) for more information on using the n8n API. Refer to [API endpoint reference](/connect/n8n-api/api-reference.md) for working with the API endpoints directly.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Credentials**

You can find authentication information for this node in the [API authentication](/connect/n8n-api/authentication.md) documentation.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**SSL**

This node doesn't support SSL. If your server requires an SSL connection, use the [HTTP Request node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest.md) to call the [n8n API](/connect/n8n-api.md). The HTTP Request node has options to [provide the SSL certificate](/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest.md#provide-an-ssl-certificate).
