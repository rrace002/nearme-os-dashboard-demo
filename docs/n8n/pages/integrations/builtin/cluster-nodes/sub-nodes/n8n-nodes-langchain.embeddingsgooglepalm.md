# Embeddings Google PaLM

Use the Embeddings Google PaLM node to generate embeddings[^1] for a given text.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Embeddings Google PaLM node, and links to more resources.

**Parameter resolution in sub-nodes**

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

* **Model**: Select the model to use to generate the embedding.

n8n dynamically loads models from the Google PaLM API and you'll only see the models available to your account.

[^1]: Embeddings are numerical representations of data using vectors. They're used by AI to interpret complex data and relationships by mapping values across many dimensions. Vector databases, or vector stores, are databases designed to store and access embeddings.
