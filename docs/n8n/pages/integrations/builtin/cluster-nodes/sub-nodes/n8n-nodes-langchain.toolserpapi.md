# SerpApi (Google Search)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Feature availability**

The SerpApi (Google Search) node is deprecated from n8n 2.35.0. Use the verified **SerpApi Official** community node instead. Refer to [Deprecated and versioned nodes](/integrations/builtin/deprecated-nodes.md) for more information.
{% endhint %}

The SerpAPI node allows an agent[^1] in your workflow to call Google's Search API.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the SerpAPI node, and links to more resources.

**Credentials**

You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/serp.md).
{% endhint %}

**Parameter resolution in sub-nodes**

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.
