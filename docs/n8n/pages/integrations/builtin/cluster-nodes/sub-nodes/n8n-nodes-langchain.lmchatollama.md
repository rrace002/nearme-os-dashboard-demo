# Ollama Chat Model

The Ollama Chat Model node allows you use local Llama 2 models with conversational agents[^1].

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Ollama Chat Model node, and links to more resources.

**Parameter resolution in sub-nodes**

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node parameters <a href="#node-parameters" id="node-parameters"></a>

* **Model**: Select the model that generates the completion. Choose from:
  * **Llama2**
  * **Llama2 13B**
  * **Llama2 70B**
  * **Llama2 Uncensored**

Refer to the Ollama [Models Library documentation](https://ollama.com/library) for more information about available models.

## Node options <a href="#node-options" id="node-options"></a>

* **Sampling Temperature**: Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.
* **Top K**: Enter the number of token choices the model uses to generate the next token.
* **Top P**: Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.

[^1]: AI agents are artificial intelligence systems capable of responding to requests, making decisions, and performing real-world tasks for users. They use large language models (LLMs) to interpret user input and make decisions about how to best process requests using the information and resources they have available.
