# GitHub Document Loader

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Feature availability**

The GitHub Document Loader node is deprecated from n8n 1.122.0. Refer to [Deprecated and versioned nodes](/integrations/builtin/deprecated-nodes.md) for more information.
{% endhint %}

Use the GitHub Document Loader node to load data from a GitHub repository for [vector stores](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] or summarization.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the GitHub Document Loader node, and links to more resources.

**Credentials**

You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/github.md). This node doesn't support OAuth for authentication.
{% endhint %}

**Parameter resolution in sub-nodes**

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.
