## Common issues <a href="#common-issues" id="common-issues"></a>

Here are some common errors and issues with the Calendly Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Node only triggers for Calendly-managed bookings <a href="#node-only-triggers-for-calendly-managed-bookings" id="node-only-triggers-for-calendly-managed-bookings"></a>

Calendly webhooks only fire for bookings and cancellations managed by Calendly. Creating or editing an event directly in a connected calendar, such as Google Calendar, won't trigger the Calendly Trigger node.

### Webhook callback URL must be public HTTPS <a href="#webhook-callback-url-must-be-public-https" id="webhook-callback-url-must-be-public-https"></a>

The Calendly Trigger node uses Calendly webhooks, and Calendly requires webhook callback URLs to be public HTTPS URLs. For local testing, use a tunnel such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/) and configure n8n to use that public HTTPS URL for webhooks. Refer to [Configuration > Webhook URL](/deploy/host-n8n/configure-n8n/basic-configuration/configuration-examples/configure-webhook-urls-with-reverse-proxy.md) for setup details.
