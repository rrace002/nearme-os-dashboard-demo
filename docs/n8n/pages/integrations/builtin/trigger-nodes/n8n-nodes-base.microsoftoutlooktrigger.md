# Microsoft Outlook Trigger

Use the Microsoft Outlook Trigger node to respond to events in [Microsoft Outlook](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/outlook/email-and-calendar-software-microsoft-outlook) and integrate Microsoft Outlook with other applications.

On this page, you'll find a list of events the Microsoft Outlook Trigger node can respond to, and links to more resources.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Credentials**

This node's **Authentication** dropdown offers three options:

* **Outlook OAuth2**: the Microsoft Outlook-specific OAuth2 credential (default).
* **Microsoft OAuth2 (Graph)**: a generic Microsoft Graph credential that you can reuse across other Microsoft nodes. When you select this option, make sure you grant the credential the scopes this node needs (for example, `Mail.ReadWrite`).
* **Microsoft Entra Service Principal (App-Only)**: app-only access through a Microsoft Entra app registration, with no signed-in user. Refer to [Microsoft Entra Service Principal credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/microsoftentraserviceprincipal.md) for setup and required application permissions.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](/integrations/builtin/credentials/microsoft.md).

**Government Cloud Support**

If you're using a government cloud tenant (US Government, US Government DOD, or China), make sure to select the appropriate **Microsoft Graph API Base URL** in your Microsoft credentials configuration.
