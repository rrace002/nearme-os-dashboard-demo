## Trigger configuration <a href="#trigger-configuration" id="trigger-configuration"></a>

To configure the trigger with this Object:

1. Select the **Credential to connect with**. Select an existing or create a new [Facebook App credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookapp.md).
2. Enter the **APP ID** of the app connected to your credential. Refer to the [Facebook App credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/facebookapp.md) documentation for more information.
3. Select **User** as the **Object**.
4. **Field Names or IDs**: By default, the node will trigger on all the available events using the `*` wildcard filter. If you'd like to limit the events, use the `X` to remove the star and use the dropdown or an expression to select the updates you're interested in.
5. In **Options**, choose whether to turn on the toggle to **Include Values**. When turned on, the node includes the new values for the changes.
