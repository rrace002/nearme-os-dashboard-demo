# TheHive Trigger

On this page, you'll find a list of events the TheHive Trigger node can respond to and links to more resources.

{% hint style="info" %}
**TheHive and TheHive 5**

n8n provides two nodes for TheHive. Use this node (TheHive Trigger) if you want to use TheHive's version 3 or 4 API. If you want to use version 5, use [TheHive 5 Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.thehive5trigger.md).

## Configure a webhook in TheHive <a href="#configure-a-webhook-in-thehive" id="configure-a-webhook-in-thehive"></a>

To configure the webhook for your TheHive instance:

1. Copy the testing and production webhook URLs from TheHive Trigger node.
2. Add the following lines to the `application.conf` file. This is TheHive configuration file:

   ```
   notification.webhook.endpoints = [
   	{
   		name: TESTING_WEBHOOK_NAME
   		url: TESTING_WEBHOOK_URL
   		version: 0
   		wsConfig: {}
   		includedTheHiveOrganisations: ["ORGANIZATION_NAME"]
   		excludedTheHiveOrganisations: []
   	},
   	{
   		name: PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_NAME
   		url: PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL
   		version: 0
   		wsConfig: {}
   		includedTheHiveOrganisations: ["ORGANIZATION_NAME"]
   		excludedTheHiveOrganisations: []
   	}
   ]
   ```
3. Replace `TESTING_WEBHOOK_URL` and `PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL` with the URLs you copied in the previous step.
4. Replace `TESTING_WEBHOOK_NAME` and `PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_NAME` with your preferred endpoint names.
5. Replace `ORGANIZATION_NAME` with your organization name.
6. Execute the following cURL command to enable notifications:

   ```sh
   curl -XPUT -uTHEHIVE_USERNAME:THEHIVE_PASSWORD -H 'Content-type: application/json' THEHIVE_URL/api/config/organisation/notification -d '
   {
   	"value": [
   		{
   		"delegate": false,
   		"trigger": { "name": "AnyEvent"},
   		"notifier": { "name": "webhook", "endpoint": "TESTING_WEBHOOK_NAME" }
   		},
   		{
   		"delegate": false,
   		"trigger": { "name": "AnyEvent"},
   		"notifier": { "name": "webhook", "endpoint": "PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_NAME" }
   		}
   	]
   }'
   ```
