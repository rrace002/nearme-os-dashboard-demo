# Stripe Trigger

[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is a suite of payment APIs that powers commerce for online businesses.

**Feature availability**

Verification of incoming requests is available from n8n 2.25.7 and n8n 2.26.2.
{% endhint %}

The Stripe Trigger node can verify that incoming webhook requests genuinely come from Stripe.

When you set a **Signature Secret** on your [Stripe credential](/integrations/builtin/credentials/stripe.md), the node checks the `Stripe-Signature` header on each request and rejects any request that's unsigned, forged, or more than five minutes old with a `401 Unauthorized` response. n8n doesn't run your workflow for rejected requests.

Without a **Signature Secret**, the node doesn't verify incoming requests, so anyone who knows your webhook URL could send forged events. n8n strongly recommends setting one. For setup steps, refer to [Verify incoming requests](/integrations/builtin/credentials/stripe.md#verify-incoming-requests).

**Examples and templates**

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Stripe Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/stripe-trigger/) page.
