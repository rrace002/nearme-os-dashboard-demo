If you need to configure OAuth2 from scratch, [register an application](https://www.zoho.com/accounts/protocol/oauth-setup.html) with Zoho.

Use these settings for your application:

* Select **Server-based Applications** as the **Client Type**.
* Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from n8n and enter it in the Zoho **Authorized Redirect URIs** field.
* Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the application and enter them in your n8n credential.
