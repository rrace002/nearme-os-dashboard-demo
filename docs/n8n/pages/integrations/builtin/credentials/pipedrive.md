# Pipedrive credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [Pipedrive](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.pipedrive.md)
* [Pipedrive Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.pipedrivetrigger.md)

## Supported authentication methods <a href="#supported-authentication-methods" id="supported-authentication-methods"></a>

* API token
* OAuth2

## Related resources <a href="#related-resources" id="related-resources"></a>

Refer to [Pipedrive's developer documentation](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/getting-started) for more information about the service.

## Using API token <a href="#using-api-token" id="using-api-token"></a>

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Pipedrive](https://pipedrive.com/) account and:

* An **API Token**

To get your API token:

1. Open your [**API Personal Preferences**](https://app.pipedrive.com/settings/api).
2. Copy **Your personal API token** and enter it in your n8n credential.

If you have multiple companies, you'll need to select the correct company first:

1. Select your account name and be sure you're viewing the correct company.
2. Then select **Company Settings**.
3. Select **Personal Preferences**.
4. Select the **API** tab.
5. Copy **Your personal API token** and enter it in your n8n credential.

Refer to [How to find the API token](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/how-to-find-the-api-token) for more information.

## Using OAuth2 <a href="#using-oauth2" id="using-oauth2"></a>

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Pipedrive developer sandbox account](https://developers.pipedrive.com/) and:

* A **Client ID**
* A **Client Secret**

To get both, you'll need to register a new app:

1. Select your profile name in the upper right corner.
2. Find the company name of your sandbox account and select **Developer Hub**.<br>

   <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="info" class="hint hint-info"><p><strong>No Developer Hub</strong></p><p>If you don't see <strong>Developer Hub</strong> in your account dropdown, sign up for a <a href="https://developers.pipedrive.com/">developer sandbox account</a>.</p></div>
3. Select **Create an app**.
4. Select **Create public app**. The app's **Basic info** tab opens.
5. Enter an **App name** for your app, like `n8n integration`.
6. Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from n8n and add it as the app's **Callback URL**.
7. Select **Save**. The app's **OAuth & access scopes** tab opens.
8. Turn on appropriate **Scopes** for your app. Refer to [Pipedrive node scopes](#pipedrive-node-scopes) and [Pipedrive Trigger node scopes](#pipedrive-trigger-node-scopes) below for more guidance.
9. Copy the **Client ID** and enter it in your n8n credential.
10. Copy the **Client Secret** and enter it in your n8n credential.

Refer to [Registering a public app](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/marketplace-registering-the-app) for more information.

### Pipedrive node scopes <a href="#pipedrive-node-scopes" id="pipedrive-node-scopes"></a>

The scopes you add to your app depend on which node(s) you want to use it for in n8n and what actions you want to complete with those.

Scopes you may need for the [Pipedrive](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.pipedrive.md) node:

| **Object**    | **Node action**                                                               | **UI scope**                                                                                 | **Actual scope**                                                       |

{% hint style="info" %}
**Files and Notes**

The scopes for Files and Notes depend on which object they relate to:

* Files relate to Deals, Activities, or Contacts.
* Notes relate to Deals or Contacts.

Refer to those objects' scopes.
{% endhint %}

The Pipedrive node also supports Custom API calls. Add relevant scopes for whatever custom API calls you intend to make.

Refer to [Scopes and permissions explanations](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/marketplace-scopes-and-permissions-explanations) for more information.

### Pipedrive Trigger node scopes <a href="#pipedrive-trigger-node-scopes" id="pipedrive-trigger-node-scopes"></a>

The [Pipedrive Trigger](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.pipedrivetrigger.md) node requires the **Webhooks: Full access** (`webhooks:full`) scope.
