# Anthropic credentials

{% hint style="info" %}
On n8n Cloud, you can skip setting up Anthropic credentials by selecting **Use Gateway credits** in the credential field of nodes that support it. Refer to [Gateway credits](https://app.gitbook.com/s/jm0ZYRpZIPWge2ZSiDYO/use-n8n-cloud/gateway-credits) for details.
{% endhint %}

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [Anthropic](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.anthropic.md)
* [Anthropic Chat Model](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatanthropic.md)
