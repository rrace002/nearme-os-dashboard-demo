# TimescaleDB credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [TimescaleDB](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.timescaledb.md)

## Prerequisites <a href="#prerequisites" id="prerequisites"></a>

An available instance of [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/).

## Supported authentication methods <a href="#supported-authentication-methods" id="supported-authentication-methods"></a>

* Database connection

## Related resources <a href="#related-resources" id="related-resources"></a>

Refer to the [Timescale documentation](https://docs.timescale.com/) for more information about the service.

## Using database connection <a href="#using-database-connection" id="using-database-connection"></a>

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* The **Host**: The fully qualified server name or IP address of your TimescaleDB server.
* The **Database**: The name of the database to connect to.
* A **User**: The user name you want to log in with.
* A **Password**: Enter the password for the database user you are connecting to.
* **Ignore SSL Issues**: If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails and you won't see the **SSL** selector.
* **SSL**: This setting controls the `ssl-mode` connection string for the connection. Options include:
  * **Allow**: Sets the `ssl-mode` parameter to `allow`. First try a non-SSL connection; if that fails, try an SSL connection.
  * **Disable**: Sets the `ssl-mode` parameter to `disable`. Only try a non-SSL connection.
  * **Require**: Sets the `ssl-mode` parameter to `require`, which is the default for TimescaleDB connection strings. Only try an SSL connection. If a root CA file is present, verify that a trusted certificate authority (CA) issued the server certificate.
* **Port**: The port number of the TimescaleDB server.

Refer to the [Timescale connection settings documentation](https://docs.tigerdata.com/integrations/latest/find-connection-details/) for more information about the non-SSL fields. Refer to [Connect with a stricter SSL](https://docs.tigerdata.com/use-timescale/latest/security/strict-ssl/) for more information about the SSL options.
