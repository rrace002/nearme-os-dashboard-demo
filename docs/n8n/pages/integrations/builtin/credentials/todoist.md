# Todoist credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

## Supported authentication methods <a href="#supported-authentication-methods" id="supported-authentication-methods"></a>

* API key
* OAuth2

Refer to [Todoist's REST API documentation](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/#overview) for more information about the service.

## Using API key <a href="#using-api-key" id="using-api-key"></a>

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) account and:

* An **API Key**

To get your **API Key**:

1. In Todoist, open your [**Integration settings**](https://todoist.com/prefs/integrations).
2. Select the **Developer** tab.
3. Copy your **API token** and enter it as the **API Key** in your n8n credential.

Refer to [Find your API token](https://todoist.com/help/articles/find-your-api-token-Jpzx9IIlB) for more information.

Get both by creating an application:

1. Open the Todoist [App Management Console](https://developer.todoist.com/appconsole.html).
2. Select **Create a new app**.
3. Enter an **App name** for your app, like `n8n integration`.
4. Select **Create app**.
5. Copy the n8n **OAuth Redirect URL** and enter it as the **OAuth redirect URL** in Todoist.
6. Copy the **Client ID** from Todoist and enter it in your n8n credential.
7. Copy the **Client Secret** from Todoist and enter it in your n8n credential.
8. Configure the rest of your Todoist app as it makes sense for your use case.
