# Miro credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate when using the [HTTP Request node](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest.md) to make a [Custom API call](/integrations/builtin/custom-api-actions-for-existing-nodes.md).

## Prerequisites <a href="#prerequisites" id="prerequisites"></a>

Create a [Miro](https://miro.com/) account.

## Supported authentication methods <a href="#supported-authentication-methods" id="supported-authentication-methods"></a>

* OAuth2

## Related resources <a href="#related-resources" id="related-resources"></a>

Refer to [Miro's API documentation](https://developers.miro.com/reference/overview) for more information about the service.

This is a credential-only node. Refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/builtin/custom-api-actions-for-existing-nodes.md) to learn more. View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/miro/) on n8n's website.

## Using OAuth2 <a href="#using-oauth2" id="using-oauth2"></a>

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Miro](https://miro.com/login/) account and app, as well as:

* A **Client ID**: Generated when you create a new OAuth2 application.

If you're [self-hosting](/deploy/host-n8n.md) n8n, you'll need to [create an app](https://developers.miro.com/docs/rest-api-build-your-first-hello-world-app) to configure OAuth2. Refer to [Miro's OAuth documentation](https://developers.miro.com/docs/getting-started-with-oauth) for more information about setting up OAuth2.
