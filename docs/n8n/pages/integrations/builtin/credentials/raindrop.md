# Raindrop credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [Raindrop](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.raindrop.md)

## Prerequisites <a href="#prerequisites" id="prerequisites"></a>

Create a [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/) account.

## Supported authentication methods <a href="#supported-authentication-methods" id="supported-authentication-methods"></a>

* OAuth2

## Related resources <a href="#related-resources" id="related-resources"></a>

Refer to [Raindrop's API documentation](https://developer.raindrop.io/) for more information about the service.

## Using OAuth <a href="#using-oauth" id="using-oauth"></a>

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* A **Client ID**
* A **Client Secret**

Generate both by creating a Raindrop app.

To create an app, go to **Settings >** [**Integrations**](https://app.raindrop.io/settings/integrations) and select **+ Create new app** in the **For Developers** section.

Use these settings for your app:

* Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from n8n and add it as a **Redirect URI** in your app.
* Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the Raindrop app and enter them in your n8n credential.
