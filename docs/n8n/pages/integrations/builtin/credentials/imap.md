## Using user account <a href="#using-user-account" id="using-user-account"></a>

To configure this credential, you'll need:

* A **User** name: The email address you're retrieving email for.
* A **Password**: Either the password you use to check email or an app password. Your provider will tell you whether to use your own password or to generate an app password.
* A **Host**: The IMAP host address for your email provider, often formatted as `imap.<provider>.com`. Check with your provider.
* A **Port** number: The default is port `993`. Use this port unless your provider or email administrator tells you to use something different.

Choose whether to use **SSL/TLS** and whether to **Allow Self-Signed Certificates**.
