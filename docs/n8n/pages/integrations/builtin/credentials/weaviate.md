### Connection type: Weaviate Cloud <a href="#connection-type-weaviate-cloud" id="connection-type-weaviate-cloud"></a>

Create your [Weaviate Cloud Database](https://docs.weaviate.io/cloud/quickstart) and [follow these instructions get the following parameter values](https://docs.weaviate.io/cloud/quickstart#13-connect-to-your-weaviate-cloud-instance) from your Weaviate Cloud Database:

* **Weaviate Cloud Endpoint**
* **Weaviate Api Key**

Note: Weaviate provides a free sandbox option for testing.

### Connection type: Custom Connection <a href="#connection-type-custom-connection" id="connection-type-custom-connection"></a>

For this Connection Type, you need to [deploy Weaviate](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy) on your own server, configured so n8n can access it. Refer to [Weaviate's authentication documentation](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/configuration/authentication#api-key-authentication) for information on creating and using API keys.

You can then provide the arguments for your custom connection:

* **Weaviate Api Key**: Your Weaviate API key.
* **Custom Connection HTTP Host**: The domain name or IP address of your Weaviate instance to use for HTTP API calls.
* **Custom Connection HTTP Port**: The port your Weaviate instance is running on for HTTP API calls. By default, this is 8080.
* **Custom Connection HTTP Secure**: Whether to connect to the Weaviate through HTTPS for HTTP API calls.
* **Custom Connection gRPC Host**: The hostname or IP address of your Weaviate instance to use for gRPC.
* **Custom Connection gRPC Port**: The gRPC API port for your Weaviate instance. By default, this is 50051.
