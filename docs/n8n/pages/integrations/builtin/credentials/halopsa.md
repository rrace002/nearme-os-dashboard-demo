To configure this credential, you'll need:

* To select your **Hosting Type**:
  * **On Premise Solution**: Choose this option if you're hosting the Halo application on your own server
  * **Hosted Solution Of Halo**: Choose this option if your application is hosted by Halo. If this option is selected, you'll need to provide your **Tenant**.
* The **HaloPSA Authorisation Server URL**: Your Authorisation Server URL is displayed within HaloPSA in **Configuration > Integrations > Halo API** in [API Details](https://halopsa.com/guides/article/?kbid=1737).
* The **Resource Server** URL: Your Resource Server is displayed within HaloPSA in **Configuration > Integrations > Halo API** in [API Details](https://halopsa.com/guides/article/?kbid=1737).
* A **Client ID**: Obtained by registering the application in the Halo API settings. Refer to [HaloPSA's Authorisation documentation](https://usehalo.com/halopsa/guides/1823/) for detailed instructions. n8n recommends using these settings:
  * Choose `Client Credentials` as your **Authentication Method**.
  * Use the `all` permission.
* A **Client Secret**: Obtained by registering the application in the Halo API settings.
* Your **Tenant** name: If **Hosted Solution of Halo** is selected as the **Hosting Type**, you must provide your tenant name. Your tenant name is displayed within HaloPSA in **Configuration > Integrations > Halo API** in [API Details](https://halopsa.com/guides/article/?kbid=1737).

HaloPSA uses both the application permissions and the agent's permissions to determine API access.
