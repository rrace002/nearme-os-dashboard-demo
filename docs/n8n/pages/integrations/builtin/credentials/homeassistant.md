# Home Assistant credentials

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

* [Home Assistant](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.homeassistant.md)

## Supported authentication methods <a href="#supported-authentication-methods" id="supported-authentication-methods"></a>

* API access token

## Related resources <a href="#related-resources" id="related-resources"></a>

Refer to [Home Assistant's API documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest) for more information about the service.

## Using API access token <a href="#using-api-access-token" id="using-api-access-token"></a>

To configure this credential, you'll need to [Install](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/) Home Assistant, create a [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/onboarding) account, and have:

* Your **Host**
* The **Port**
* A Long-Lived **Access Token**

To generate an access token and set up the credential:

1. To generate your **Access Token**, log in to Home Assistant and open your [User profile](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/profile).
2. In the **Long-Lived Access Tokens** section, generate a new token.
3. Copy this token and enter it in n8n as your **Access Token**.
4. Enter the URL or IP address of your Home Assistant **Host**, without the `http://` or `https://` protocol, for example `your.awesome.home`.
5. For the **Port**, enter the appropriate port:
   * If you've made no port changes and access Home Assistant at `http://`, keep the default of `8123`.
   * If you've made no port changes and access Home Assistant at `https://`, enter `443`.
   * If you've configured Home Assistant to use a specific port, enter that port.
6. If you've enabled SSL in Home Assistant in the [config.yml map key](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/add-ons/configuration/?_highlight=ssl#add-on-configuration), turn on the **SSL** toggle in n8n. If you're not sure, it's best to turn this setting on if you access your home assistant UI using `https://` instead of `http://`.
