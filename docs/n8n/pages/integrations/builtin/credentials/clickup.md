To configure this credential, you'll need a [ClickUp](https://www.clickup.com/) account and:

* A Personal API **Access Token**

To get your personal API token:

1. If you're using ClickUp 2.0, select your avatar in the lower-left corner and select **Apps**. If you're using ClickUp 3.0, select your avatar in the upper-right corner, select **Settings**, and scroll down to select **Apps** in the sidebar.
2. Under **API Token**, select **Generate**.
3. Copy your **Personal API token** and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Access Token**.

7. Select **Connect my account** and follow the on-screen prompts to finish connecting the credential.
