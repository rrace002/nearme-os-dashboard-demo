# Set the timezone

The default timezone is America/New\_York. For instance, the Schedule node uses it to know at what time the workflow should start. To set a different default timezone, set `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` to the appropriate value. For example, if you want to set the timezone to Berlin (Germany):

```bash
export GENERIC_TIMEZONE=Europe/Berlin
```

You can find the name of your timezone [here](https://momentjs.com/timezone/).

Refer to [Environment variables reference](/deploy/host-n8n/configure-n8n/basic-configuration/use-environment-variables/timezone-and-localization.md) for more information on this variable.
